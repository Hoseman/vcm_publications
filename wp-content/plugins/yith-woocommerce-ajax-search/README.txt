YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search allows your users to search products in real time.

== Description ==

= Improve user experience, improve your sales =

YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search is a very easy-to-use plugin for WooCommerce. You just need to install it and it's ready to work.

It creates a simple search box that shows you instant search results, by suggesting you products from your WooCommerce store that match your searching criteria.

It is very useful to assist your users while they are trying to search any product in your website. They can just enter a keyword for the WooCommerce product they are looking for and YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search will spare them the nuisance to browse all WooCommerce categories one at a time. 

Did you ever forget the name of a WooCommerce product? Just start to write your keyphrase. A list of useful suggestion will be shown to you  and the more you write, the more accurate search results will be. At that point, you'll only need to choose what you need.

It works just like Google Suggest, but this tool will be available on your WooCommerce site and will be using your database.

* [**YITH Woocommerce Quick view**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yith-woocommerce-quick-view/)
* [**YITH Woocommerce magnifier**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yith-woocommerce-zoom-magnifier/)
* [**YITH Woocommerce Ajax Product Filter**](http://it.wordpress.org/plugins/yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation/)
* [**YITH Woocommerce Infinite scrolling**](http://it.wordpress.org/plugins/yith-infinite-scrolling/)

Nevertheless, it could be compatible with many other WooCommerce plugins that have not been tested yet. If you want to inform us about compatibility with other plugins, please, [email to us](mailto:plugins@yithemes.com "Your Inspiration Themes").

== Installation ==
Important: First of all, you have to download and activate WooCommerce plugin, because without it YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search cannot work.

1. Unzip the downloaded .zip file.
2. Upload the YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search` from Plugins page


= Configuration =
YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search will add a new tab called "Ajax Search" in "YITH" menu. There, you will find all YITH plugins and you will be able to access quickly plugin settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YITH, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.


= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks! 


= How can I get more features for my WooCommerce plugin? =
You can get more features with the premium version of YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search, available on [YITH page]( https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-ajax-search/). Here you can read more about the premium features of the plugin and make it give it its best shot!


= How can I try the full-featured plugin? =

If you want to see a demonstration version of the premium plugin, you can see that in [this page](https://plugins.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-ajax-search/). Browse it and try all options available so that you can see how your plugin looks like.

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
Recently YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme.
In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yit' to 'yith-woocommerce-ajax-search'.
Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org.
During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in:

* yith-woocommerce-ajax-search-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].po
* yith-woocommerce-ajax-search-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].mo

== Suggestions ==
If you have any suggestions for improving YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search, you can [write to us](mailto:plugins@yithemes.com "Your Inspiration Themes"), and contribute in making your YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search more and more performing.

== Translators ==

= Available Languages =
* English (Default)
* Italian

If you have created your own language pack for YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search, or have an update for an existing one, you can send [gettext PO and MO file](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress "Translating WordPress")
[to us](mailto:plugins@yithemes.com "Your Inspiration Themes") so we can bundle it into YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search.

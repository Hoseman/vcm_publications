The most popular WooCommerce product search plugin. Gives your users a well-designed advanced AJAX search bar with live search suggestions.

== Description ==

The most popular **WooCommerce product search plugin**. Gives your users a well-designed advanced AJAX search bar with live search suggestions.

By default, WooCommerce provides a very simple search solution, without live product search or even SKU search. Ajax Search for WooCommerce provides advanced search with live suggestions.

Who doesn’t love instant, as-you-type suggestions? In 2020, customers simply expect smart product search. Baymard Institute’s latest UX research reveals that search autocomplete, auto-suggest, or instant search feature **is now offered at 96% of major e-commerce sites**. It's a must-have feature for every online business that can’t afford to lose customers. Why? AJAX search helps users save time and makes shopping easier. As a result, it really boosts sales.

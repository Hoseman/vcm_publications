The most popular WooCommerce product search plugin. Gives your users a well-designed advanced AJAX search bar with live search suggestions.

== Description ==

The most popular **WooCommerce product search plugin**. It gives your users a well-designed advanced AJAX search bar with live search suggestions.

By default, WooCommerce provides a very simple search solution, without live product search or even SKU search. FiboSearch (Ajax Search for WooCommerce) provides advanced search with live suggestions.

Who doesn’t love instant, as-you-type suggestions? In 2021, customers expect smart product search. Baymard Institute’s latest UX research reveals that search autocomplete, auto-suggest, or an instant search feature **is now offered on 96% of major e-commerce sites**. It's a must-have feature for every online business that can’t afford to lose customers. Why? FiboSearch helps users save time and makes shopping easier. As a result, it really boosts sales.

– **Using a shortcode**

`[fibosearch]`

= How can I ask a question? =
You can submit a ticket on the plugin [website](https://fibosearch.com/contact/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=asfw&utm_content=contact&utm_gen=utmdc) and the support team will get in touch with you shortly. We also answer questions on the [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ajax-search-for-woocommerce/).

Depending on the theme you use, sometimes the search bar requires minor improvements in appearance. We guarantee fast CSS corrections for all Pro plugin users, but we also help Free plugin users.

= Where can I find plugin settings? =
In your WordPress dashboard, go to `WooCommerce → FiboSearch`. The FiboSearch settings page is a submenu of the WooCommerce menu.

= Who is the Pro plugin version for? =
The Pro plugin version is for all online sellers looking to **increase sales** by providing an ultra-fast smart search engine to their clients.

The main difference between the Pro and Free versions is search speed and search scope. The Pro version has a new fast smart search engine. For some online stores that offer a lot of products for sale, search speed can be increased **up to 10×**, providing a whole new experience to end users.

All in all, the Pro version is dedicated to all WooCommerce shops where autocomplete suggestions work too slowly.
